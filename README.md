Handwrittne Recognition MLP - MNIST

A sample handwritten recognition using MNIST database. Project developed for InteligÃªncia Artificial Aplciada grade at UFRN-Brazil.

Getting Started

This project is compound by two modules: Server in Python and an Android client.

Server

The first step in server module is train the neural network and save the result weights: mnist_syn0.txt and mnist_syn1.txt. After that, it is possible to perform the tests with the file nn_mnist_test.py. With the neural network trained and tests Ok, just run the HTTP server http_server.py.

Client

To use the android client just install the app-debug.apk, located in Client/NNHandwritten/app-debug.apk
